3. Performance & SEO Check
[ ] Run npm run build locally to ensure no broken image paths.

[ ] Verify FeatureImage.astro is generating .webp versions in the dist folder.

[ ] Check Meta Tags in src/layouts/Layout.astro (Title/Description).

4. Deployment (Netlify)
[ ] Commit and Push to GitHub: git add . && git commit -m "feat: client update" && git push.

[ ] Verify build success in Netlify Dashboard.

[ ] Forms: Go to Netlify -> Forms and ensure the "contact" form is detected.

[ ] Optimization: Enable "Image Optimization" and "Minification" in Netlify build settings.

5. Delivery to Client
[ ] Generate Lighthouse Report (Target: 95-100 across the board).

[ ] Send live URL + Lighthouse Screenshot to client.

[ ] (Optional) Provide instructions for Netlify Form notification settings.

Pro Tip for Fiverr:
When you deliver the order, include the Lighthouse Score screenshot. Clients on Fiverr love seeing that "All Green" circle 100/100; it justifies the price of a modern static site over a slow WordPress site.

Would you like me to help you write a "Technical Specifications" snippet? You can paste it into your Fiverr Gig description to explain why your sites are faster than the competition.

# Astro Starter Kit: Minimal

```sh
npm create astro@latest -- --template minimal
```

> 🧑‍🚀 **Seasoned astronaut?** Delete this file. Have fun!

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
├── src/
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `npm run astro -- --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |
